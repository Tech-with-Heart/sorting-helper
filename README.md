## Development

The application is still in the development phase. New points and features will be added successively. If you want to help develop the app, feel free to contribute!

The app consists of two projects: `client` and `server`. Since there is currently no deployed version, you need to run both at the same time.

In the `client` folder:

`npm i`
`npm run start`

In the `server` folder:

`npm i`
`ng serve`
